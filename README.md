## Development Analysis for Custom Sharable Link Feature

# Objective

The objective is to implement a feature that allows clients to generate custom sharable links for their booking page within the SaaS CRM solution. This feature aims to enhance client engagement by enabling them to promote their booking services effectively on external platforms.

Requirements
```sh
Client Interface:
```

Provide a user-friendly interface within the CRM dashboard for clients to generate custom links.

Input field for clients to enter a custom tag or identifier.

```sh
Backend Logic:
```

Generate a unique URL incorporating the custom tag provided by the client.

Optionally store the mapping of custom tags to booking page URLs for future reference.

Handle the redirection of users who click on the generated custom links to the correct booking page.

```sh
User Experience:
```

Clients should be able to easily copy and share the generated custom link on various platforms.
Users clicking on the custom link should seamlessly land on the respective booking page.

Development Steps

```sh
Frontend Development:
```

UI Design: Create a form component within the CRM dashboard where clients can input their custom tag.

Interaction: Implement client-side validation to ensure proper input format and length restrictions for the custom tag.

API Integration: Use Axios or similar libraries to communicate with the backend API for generating and retrieving custom links.

```sh
Backend Development:
```

API Endpoint: Design RESTful API endpoints to handle:

Input validation and error handling for the custom tag.

Generation of a unique URL incorporating the custom tag.

Optionally, storing the mapping of custom tags to booking page URLs in a database (MongoDB or similar).

Redirection logic to correctly route users based on the custom link clicked.

Business Logic: Implement backend services to generate the custom link and manage the storage and retrieval of mappings (if applicable).

Security: Ensure secure handling of URLs and validation to prevent misuse or abuse.

```sh
Database Integration:
```

Schema Design: If storing mappings, design a schema to efficiently store and retrieve custom tag to URL mappings.

Integration: Integrate database operations within the backend API to persist and fetch custom link mappings.

```sh
Testing:
```

Unit Testing: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of backend services and API endpoints.

Integration Testing: Test the integration between frontend and backend to ensure seamless operation of the custom link generation and redirection.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve stakeholders (clients) to validate the user interface and functionality from a usability standpoint.

```sh
Deployment and Monitoring:
```

Deployment: Deploy backend services to a suitable environment (e.g., AWS, Azure) with proper scaling capabilities.

Monitoring: Implement monitoring and logging to track API usage, errors, and performance metrics.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up pipelines for automated testing and deployment to ensure rapid iteration and reliability.

Considerations

Scalability: Ensure that the system can handle a potentially large number of custom links and concurrent requests.

Security: Implement secure practices to protect against malicious input and unauthorized access to generated links.

Performance: Optimize database queries and backend logic to maintain fast response times.

User Experience: Focus on a seamless user experience both for clients generating links and for users clicking on them.
